# Implementation Planning Validation Review
## SQL Flag Feature Task Specification Review

**Review ID**: planning-a1b2c3d4  
**Specification**: spec-a1b2c3d4-sql-flag.md  
**Prior Review**: review-architect-sql-flag.md  
**Reviewed**: 2026-01-17 11:45 GMT+10:30  
**Reviewer**: Implementation Planning Validator  
**Status**: ✅ APPROVED WITH MINOR IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED

---

## Executive Summary

**Go/No-Go Decision**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

All 12 task files are **clear, specific, and implementable by a solo engineer** with zero codebase context. Tasks include:
- ✅ Exact file paths and locations
- ✅ Complete code examples (pseudo-code where appropriate)
- ✅ Step-by-step implementation guidance
- ✅ Clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Proper dependencies documented

**Minor Issues Found** (all addressable before starting):
- ⚠️ Three recommended improvements from architect review need explicit mention in tasks
- ⚠️ CLI flag location needs verification (cmd/search.go vs actual filename)
- ⚠️ Result set size limit mentioned in architecture but not in task
- ⚠️ Empty query validation mentioned but not in validation task

**Recommendation**: **Proceed to implementation** after addressing 2-3 clarifications below.

---

## Task-by-Task Analysis

### STORY 1: CORE FUNCTIONALITY (MVP)

#### Task 1: Add DbService.GetReadOnlyDB() Method ✅ CLEAR
**File**: task-4f209693-add-readonly-db.md

**Clarity Score**: 9/10

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Exact file path: `internal/services/db.go`
- ✅ Clear method signature
- ✅ DuckDB parameter documented: `?access_mode=READ_ONLY`
- ✅ Markdown load command: `LOAD markdown`
- ✅ Error handling pattern provided
- ✅ Logging pattern provided
- ✅ Related code examples referenced
- ✅ Clear dependencies section
- ✅ Time estimate realistic (45 minutes)

**Potential Gaps**:
- ⚠️ Doesn't specify what to check if markdown extension load fails
  - **Question**: Should we document the error message pattern expected?
  - **Impact**: LOW (developer can look at existing pattern)

**Acceptance Criteria Assessment**: 
- All 10 criteria are testable and measurable ✅
- "Code compiles without warnings" - slightly vague but understood
- "Follows existing code patterns" - can be validated by review

**New Developer Perspective**: A developer unfamiliar with codebase would:
1. Find `internal/services/db.go` ✅
2. See `DbService` struct ✅
3. Follow the code example provided ✅
4. Look at existing patterns for logging ✅
5. Write implementation successfully ✅

**Verdict**: ✅ **READY**

---

#### Task 2: Add SQL Query Validation ✅ VERY CLEAR
**File**: task-d4548dcd-sql-validation.md

**Clarity Score**: 10/10

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Exact file path: `internal/services/note.go`
- ✅ Complete code example provided (copy-paste ready)
- ✅ Test cases listed explicitly
- ✅ All blocked keywords listed
- ✅ Clear error message examples
- ✅ Function signature clear
- ✅ Implementation pattern complete

**Potential Issues**:
- 🔴 **ISSUE**: Architecture review recommends adding empty query validation
  - Current task doesn't explicitly mention checking for empty/whitespace-only queries
  - Example shows basic logic but could be clearer about edge case

**Acceptance Criteria Assessment**:
- All 14+ criteria are testable ✅
- "Error messages descriptive" - examples provided ✅

**New Developer Perspective**: 
- Would understand exactly what to implement ✅
- Could copy the code example verbatim ✅
- Might miss empty query edge case ⚠️

**Recommendation**: Add this test case to the Implementation Notes:
```go
// Should fail
- "" (empty string)
- "   " (whitespace only)
```

**Verdict**: ✅ **READY WITH MINOR ADDITION**

---

#### Task 3: Add NoteService.ExecuteSQLSafe() Method ✅ CLEAR
**File**: task-bef53880-execute-sql-safe.md

**Clarity Score**: 8/10

**Strengths**:
- ✅ File path specified: `internal/services/note.go`
- ✅ Complete method flow diagram provided
- ✅ Detailed error cases documented
- ✅ Dependencies clearly listed
- ✅ Dependencies have linked task files
- ✅ Time estimate realistic (60 minutes)

**Potential Issues**:
- 🔴 **IMPORTANT**: Task says "Check if already exists" for rowsToMaps()
  - This is a blocker if developer can't find it
  - Should provide exact location or fallback plan
  
- ⚠️ Architecture review suggests adding result set size limit (implicit LIMIT 10000)
  - Task doesn't mention this
  - Should either: (a) add to this task, or (b) be clear about what architecture requires

**Blockers Section Analysis**:
- Lists "Need to verify rowsToMaps() exists" ✓ Good
- But task doesn't provide resolution path

**New Developer Perspective**:
- Would understand main flow ✅
- Would get stuck finding rowsToMaps() ❌
- Might miss result limit requirement ❌

**Questions for Clarification**:
1. Where is rowsToMaps() located? (Should verify before starting)
2. Should result set limit be added in ExecuteSQLSafe or validateSQLQuery?
3. What's the implementation if rowsToMaps doesn't exist? (Create it? Where?)

**Recommendation**: Update task with:
```markdown
### Important: Result Set Limit

Per architecture review, add implicit LIMIT 10000 if user query doesn't specify LIMIT:

// After validateSQLQuery(query) passes:
if !strings.Contains(strings.ToUpper(query), "LIMIT") {
    query = query + " LIMIT 10000"
}
```

**Verdict**: ✅ **READY WITH CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED**

---

#### Task 4: Add DisplayService.RenderSQLResults() Method ✅ VERY CLEAR
**File**: task-c7fc4f57-render-sql-results.md

- ✅ Realistic time estimate (45 minutes)

**Potential Issues**:
- ⚠️ Nil value handling mentioned ("formatted as empty or null") but not explicit in code
  - **Minor issue**: Developer would figure this out easily

**Edge Case Coverage**:
- Empty results ✅
- Single column ✅
- Single row ✅
- Wide content ✅
- Nil values ✅
- Mixed types ✅

**New Developer Perspective**: Would understand exactly what to build ✅

**Verdict**: ✅ **READY**

---

#### Task 5: Add --sql Flag to Search Command ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**File**: task-710bd5bd-sql-flag-cli.md

**Clarity Score**: 7/10

**Strengths**:
- ✅ Clear objective
- ✅ Error handling examples
- ✅ Implementation pattern provided
- ✅ Dependencies well-documented

**Critical Issues**:
- 🔴 **FILE PATH VERIFICATION NEEDED**: Task says `cmd/search.go` but project might use different structure
  - Need to verify actual search command file location
  - Bash search: `grep -r "search" cmd/` would help
  - **BLOCKER for developer if wrong path**

- 🔴 **CONTEXT STRUCTURE**: Task says "ctx.store.noteService" but doesn't verify this is correct
  - Different CLI frameworks have different context patterns
  - Clerc might use different structure
  - **BLOCKER if context access is wrong**

- ⚠️ Help text update mentioned but not detailed
  - Should add reference to task-3cc36897-cli-help.md

**Questions for Clarification**:
1. What's the actual search command file location?
2. How is context structured in Clerc (ctx.store.field vs ctx.field vs something else)?
3. Should ServiceAccess section be in AGENTS.md for reference?

**Recommendation**: Before implementation, verify and update:
- Actual command file location (might be `cmd/notes_search.go` or similar)
- Correct context access pattern (run a Clerc example)
- Add reference to help text task

**Verdict**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTABLE BUT NEEDS VERIFICATION**

---

#### Task 6: Write SQL Unit Tests ✅ COMPREHENSIVE

  - Project uses Go (not Bun TypeScript)
  - Should be `go test` not Vitest
  - **ERROR in task description** but test structure is correct for Go

- ⚠️ Assertions library mentioned: "testify/require"
  - Good choice, but should verify it's available in project
  - Look at existing test files for verification

**Test Coverage Assessment**:
- validateSQLQuery: 16 test cases ✅ Excellent
- GetReadOnlyDB: 5-6 test cases ✅ Good
- ExecuteSQLSafe: 13 test cases ✅ Good
- RenderSQLResults: 10 test cases ✅ Good
- Total ~44 tests planned ✅ Realistic for 90 minutes

**New Developer Perspective**:
- Would understand test structure ✅
- Could write tests from acceptance criteria ✅
- Might be confused by "Vitest" mention ❌

**Recommendation**: 
Update task description to clarify:
```
Framework: Go testing (testing package)
Assertion Library: testify/assert and testify/require
Run tests with: mise run test
```

**Verdict**: ✅ **READY WITH FRAMEWORK CLARIFICATION**

---

## Sequence & Dependency Validation

### Story 1 Execution Order ✅ CORRECT

```
Task 1 (GetReadOnlyDB)
  ↓
Task 2 (Validation)     ← Can start in parallel
  ↓
Task 3 (ExecuteSQLSafe) ← Depends on 1 & 2
  ↓
Task 4 (RenderResults)  ← Independent
  ↓
Task 5 (CLI Integration) ← Depends on 3 & 4
  ↓
Task 6 (Unit Tests)     ← Depends on all above
```

**Critical Path Analysis**:
- Shortest critical path: 1 → 3 → 5 → 6 (4 tasks)
- Actual path is optimal for solo developer
- Parallelization opportunities:
  - Tasks 1, 2, 4 can start together
  - Tasks 4, 2 completely independent
  - Task 1 blocks Task 3

**Recommendation**: 
1. Start Task 1 (45 min) + Task 2 (30 min) + Task 4 (45 min) in parallel ✓
2. Then Task 3 (60 min) depends on 1 & 2
3. Then Task 5 (30 min) depends on 3 & 4
4. Finally Task 6 (90 min) integration

**Total Estimated Time**: 
- Sequential if done alone: 45+30+60+45+30+90 = 300 minutes (5 hours)
- With noted parallelization: Solo developer sees: 45+60+30+90 = 225 minutes (3.75 hours) ✓
  - (Tasks 1,2,4 take max 45, then 3 at 60, then 5 at 30, then 6 at 90)

**Spec Estimate was**: 3-4 hours ✅ **Matches**

---

### Story 2 & 3 Parallelization ✅ EXCELLENT

**Story 2 tasks** (Tasks 7, 8, 9):
- Can start after Story 1 complete
- Completely independent of each other
- Can be done in any order
- No blockers for Story 1 completion

**Story 3 tasks** (Tasks 10, 11, 12):
- Task 10 (help text): Depends on Task 5 (done) ✓
- Task 11 (user guide): Can be done in parallel with Task 5 ✓
- Task 12 (function docs): Completely independent ✓

**Optimal Parallelization**:
- Stories 2 & 3 can run **concurrently** with Story 1 ✅
- For solo engineer: do Stories 2 & 3 after Story 1
- **For team**: 3 engineers could work in parallel

---

## Clarity Gaps & Missing Context

### Gap 1: Actual File Locations ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Issue**: Tasks assume file paths but don't verify they exist:
- `cmd/search.go` - Is this the correct file?
- `internal/services/db.go` - Verified ✓
- `internal/services/note.go` - Verified ✓
- `internal/services/display.go` - Exists?

**Recommendation**: Verify actual project structure before starting Task 5:
```bash
ls -la cmd/
ls -la internal/services/
grep -r "search" cmd/
```

**Impact**: LOW - would be caught in first few minutes

---

### Gap 2: Result Set Size Limit ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Issue**: Architecture review requires implicit LIMIT 10000, but:
- Not mentioned in ExecuteSQLSafe task (Task 3)
- Not mentioned in Validation task (Task 2)
- Should be explicit for developer

**Where it belongs**: Task 3 (ExecuteSQLSafe) or Task 2 (Validation)

**Recommendation**: Add to Task 3 Implementation Notes:
```go
// Add result set limit if user query doesn't specify one
if !strings.Contains(strings.ToUpper(query), "LIMIT") {
    query = query + " LIMIT 10000"
}
```

---

### Gap 3: Empty Query Validation ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Issue**: Architecture review requires validation of empty queries, but:
- Not explicitly in Task 2 (Validation)
- Not mentioned in acceptance criteria
- Could be a gotcha

**Recommendation**: Add to Task 2 test cases and implementation:
```go
if strings.TrimSpace(query) == "" {
    return fmt.Errorf("SQL query cannot be empty")
}
```

---

### Gap 4: Timeout Documentation in Help ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Issue**: Architecture review recommends 30-second timeout be documented in help text

**Current State**:
- Task 10 (CLI help) doesn't explicitly mention timeout
- Should add: "30 second timeout" to flag description

**Recommendation**: Update Task 10 help text template to include:
```
--sql string    Execute custom SQL query (read-only, 30s timeout)
```

---

### Gap 5: Context Structure in Clerc ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Issue**: Task 5 (CLI Integration) assumes context structure but doesn't verify:
- `ctx.store.noteService` - Is this correct for this project?
- `ctx.store.displayService` - Where does DisplayService come from?

**Recommendation**: Add verification step to Task 5:
```markdown
### IMPORTANT: Verify Context Structure

Before implementing, check how services are accessed:
1. Look at existing command implementation
2. Check AGENTS.md for context structure
3. Verify: ctx.store.noteService, ctx.store.displayService
```

---

### Gap 6: rowsToMaps() Location ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Issue**: Task 3 (ExecuteSQLSafe) says "Check if already exists"

**Critical for Developer**: Where is it actually located?
- Option A: Already exists in DbService - reuse it
- Option B: Needs to be extracted to shared location
- Option C: Needs to be created

**Recommendation**: Update Task 3 with explicit check:
```markdown
### rowsToMaps() Location

Check if rowsToMaps() exists:
1. Search: grep -r "rowsToMaps" internal/
2. If found in DbService: import and reuse
3. If not found: Create in internal/services/note.go as private function
4. See specification for complete implementation
```

---

### Gap 7: DisplayService Existence ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Issue**: Tasks assume DisplayService exists and has specific methods

**Verification Needed**: Does DisplayService exist already?
- If yes: Where? (internal/services/display.go?)
- If no: Need to create it first

**Recommendation**: Add pre-flight check to tasks:
```bash
# Verify DisplayService exists
grep -r "type DisplayService" internal/
grep -r "type Display " internal/
```

---

## Testing Requirements Assessment

### Unit Test Coverage ✅ EXCELLENT

Task 6 specifies >80% coverage target with:
- validateSQLQuery: 16 test cases
- GetReadOnlyDB: 5-6 test cases
- ExecuteSQLSafe: 13+ test cases
- RenderSQLResults: 10+ test cases
- **Total: ~44-50 test cases planned**

**Coverage Analysis**:
- Positive cases ✅ Well covered
- Negative cases ✅ Well covered
- Edge cases ✅ Mentioned (empty results, nil values, etc.)
- Timeout scenario ✅ Mentioned
- Error handling ✅ Covered

**Test Quality Assessment**:
- Table-driven pattern ✅ Mentioned
- Assertion library ✅ Specified (testify)
- Cleanup ✅ Mentioned (t.Cleanup)
- Mock strategy ✅ Mentioned (test helpers)

**Concerns**:
- ⚠️ Framework mismatch: "Vitest" vs Go `testing` package (minor documentation issue)
- ⚠️ No mention of integration test environment setup (databases, temp files)

---

### Integration Test Strategy ✅ ADEQUATE

**Current Plan** (from Task 6):
- End-to-end flow testing
- Real query against markdown files
- Error message quality

**Gaps**:
- ⚠️ No mention of test data setup
- ⚠️ No mention of teardown/cleanup
- ⚠️ No mention of performance baseline testing

**Recommendation**: Add to Task 6 (or create Task 6.5):
```markdown
### Integration Test Setup

For end-to-end tests:
1. Create temporary test notebook with sample markdown files
2. Include test cases for:
   - Real markdown with code blocks
   - Frontmatter metadata
   - Multi-file queries
3. Clean up temp files after tests
```

---

### Manual Testing ✅ MENTIONED BUT MINIMAL

**Current Plan** (from specification):
- Extract code blocks from real notes
- Find notes by word count
- Search metadata fields
- Complex queries with JOINs
- Error messages are clear
- Performance is acceptable

**Gap**: No task explicitly assigned for manual testing

**Recommendation**: This should be done during task completion:
- Task 5 (CLI) should include manual smoke test
- Task 6 (Tests) should verify unit + integration coverage
- Final validation before submission

---

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK AREAS

#### 🔴 Risk 1: CLI Integration Context Structure
**Probability**: MEDIUM (unknown framework details)
**Impact**: BLOCKER (can't implement Task 5)
**Mitigation**: Verify context structure in existing commands before starting
**Recommendation**: Update Task 5 with explicit verification steps

#### 🔴 Risk 2: rowsToMaps() Location Unknown
**Probability**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: BLOCKER (can't implement Task 3)
**Mitigation**: Search codebase thoroughly
**Recommendation**: Add pre-task verification to Task 3

#### 🔴 Risk 3: DisplayService Missing or Located Elsewhere
**Probability**: LOW
**Impact**: BLOCKER (can't implement Task 4)
**Mitigation**: Verify DisplayService exists
**Recommendation**: Add verification step to Task 4

### MEDIUM RISK AREAS

#### 🟡 Risk 4: Result Set Size Limit Implementation
**Probability**: MEDIUM (not fully specified)
**Impact**: Moderate (would be caught in code review)
**Mitigation**: Clarify where to add LIMIT clause
**Recommendation**: Add explicit implementation to Task 3

#### 🟡 Risk 5: Empty Query Validation
**Probability**: MEDIUM (not fully specified)
**Impact**: Moderate (would be caught in testing)
**Mitigation**: Add explicit test case
**Recommendation**: Add to Task 2 test cases

#### 🟡 Risk 6: Timeout Implementation Correctness
**Probability**: LOW (Go stdlib handles this)
**Impact**: Moderate (could be silent failure)
**Mitigation**: Task 6 includes timeout test case
**Recommendation**: Ensure Task 3 properly tests timeout

### LOW RISK AREAS

#### 🟢 Risk 7: Code Pattern Misalignment
**Probability**: LOW (spec provides examples)
**Impact**: Low (would be caught in code review)
**Mitigation**: Examples follow existing patterns

#### 🟢 Risk 8: Test Framework Confusion
**Probability**: MEDIUM (Vitest vs Go testing mentioned)
**Impact**: Low (would be clarified immediately)
**Mitigation**: Update Task 6 description

---

## Code Examples & Pattern Consistency

---

## Acceptance Criteria Analysis

### Story 1 MVP Criteria ✅ ALL TESTABLE

**Combined acceptance criteria across all tasks**:
- 60+ individual acceptance criteria items
- All are objective and measurable
- Examples:
  - "Markdown extension loads" → can test
  - "Write attempts fail" → can test
  - "SELECT queries allowed" → can test
  - "Error messages descriptive" → can test
  - "Code compiles without warnings" → can test

**Verdict**: ✅ All acceptance criteria are verifiable

---

### Test Coverage Alignment ✅ GOOD

**Acceptance criteria to test mapping**:
- For each acceptance criterion, at least one test exists
- Coverage matrix:
  - GetReadOnlyDB: 8-10 criteria → 5-6 tests planned ✓
  - validateSQLQuery: 14 criteria → 16 tests planned ✓
  - ExecuteSQLSafe: 13 criteria → 13 tests planned ✓
  - RenderSQLResults: 10+ criteria → 10+ tests planned ✓

**Verdict**: ✅ Test coverage adequate

---

## Missing Tasks or Implementation Gaps

### Gap Analysis: Are all requirements covered?

**Functional Requirements (from spec)**:
- FR-1: `--sql` flag → Task 5 ✓
- FR-2: Query validation → Task 2 ✓
- FR-3: Read-only mode → Task 1 ✓
- FR-4: Table display → Task 4 ✓
- FR-5: Query timeout → Task 3 ✓
- FR-6: Error handling → All tasks ✓
- FR-7: Help documentation → Task 10 ✓
- FR-8: Schema documentation → Task 12 ✓
- FR-9: Example queries → Task 11 ✓

**All FR MUST requirements have tasks** ✅

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- NFR-1: Performance → No explicit task, but implicitly in Task 3 & 6
- NFR-2: Security → Implicit across Tasks 1, 2, 3
- NFR-3: Usability (error messages) → Task 10, 11
- NFR-4: Compatibility → Not explicitly tested

**Assessment**: NFR coverage is implicit, should be OK for MVP

---

### Architectural Requirements Met?

**From Architecture Review**:
- ✅ Result set size limit (SHOULD) → Not in task, needs addition
- ✅ Empty query validation (MUST) → Not explicitly in task
- ✅ 30-second timeout documentation (SHOULD) → Task 10 should mention

**3 items need minor clarifications** (non-blocker)

---

### Integration Points Covered?

**Integration between tasks**:
- Task 1 → Task 3: ✅ Explicit dependency
- Task 2 → Task 3: ✅ Explicit dependency
- Task 3 → Task 5: ✅ Explicit dependency
- Task 4 → Task 5: ✅ Explicit dependency
- Task 5 → Task 6: ✅ Explicit dependency
- All tasks properly linked ✅

---

## Required Changes Before Starting Implementation

### 🔴 MUST FIX (Blockers)

#### 1. Verify CLI Integration Context Structure
**Issue**: Task 5 assumes ctx.store.noteService pattern
**Action**: 
```bash
# Check actual context structure in existing commands
grep -r "ctx\." cmd/ | head -5
grep -r "Flags()" cmd/ | head -5
```
**Recommendation**: Update Task 5 with verified access pattern

#### 2. Locate rowsToMaps() Function
**Issue**: Task 3 says "check if exists" but no resolution
**Action**:
```bash
# Search for existing implementation
grep -r "rowsToMaps" internal/
grep -r "RowsToMaps" internal/
grep -r "rows.Columns()" internal/
```
**Recommendation**: Update Task 3 with exact location or create plan

#### 3. Add Explicit Result Set Limit
**Issue**: Architecture requires implicit LIMIT 10000, but not in task
**Action**: Update Task 3 ExecuteSQLSafe() section:
```markdown
### Result Set Size Limit

Add implicit LIMIT if not specified (prevents memory issues):

```go
if !strings.Contains(strings.ToUpper(query), "LIMIT") {
    query = query + " LIMIT 10000"
}
```
```

### 🟡 SHOULD FIX (Improvements)

#### 4. Add Empty Query Validation to Task 2
**Action**: Add test case to validateSQLQuery():
```
- "" (empty string)
- "   " (whitespace only)
```

#### 5. Update Task 10 Help Text to Mention Timeout
**Action**: Include in flag description:
```
--sql string    Execute custom SQL query (read-only, 30s timeout)
```

#### 6. Fix Task 6 Framework Description
**Action**: Change "Vitest" reference to "Go testing package":
```markdown
Framework: Go `testing` package
Assertion Library: testify/assert and testify/require
Run tests: mise run test
```

#### 7. Add DisplayService Verification
**Action**: Add pre-check to Task 4:
```bash
# Verify DisplayService exists
grep -r "type Display" internal/services/
```

## Specific Questions Answered

### 1. Can each task be completed in isolation by a solo engineer?
**Answer**: ✅ **YES, with caveats**

- **Story 1 MVP tasks**: Need to be done in order (1→2→3→4→5→6)
- **Story 2 tasks**: Can be done independently after MVP
- **Story 3 tasks**: Can be done independently (mostly)

**Caveat**: Tasks 1, 2, 4 can parallelize, but solo developer would do sequentially

---

### 2. Would the task file be sufficient to understand what to build?
**Answer**: ✅ **YES, 90%**

- All tasks have clear objectives
- Code examples provided
- Acceptance criteria explicit
- **Gap**: Context structure needs verification (5% gap)

---

### 3. Are there terms or concepts that need more explanation?
**Answer**: ✅ **NO**

- All Go/DuckDB concepts explained in spec
- References provided (db.go, note.go, existing patterns)
- No unexplained jargon

---

### 4. Should any tasks be merged or split?
**Answer**: ✅ **NO**

- Task granularity is appropriate
- Each task is 30-90 minutes (good chunk size)
- Dependencies are clear
- Current split is optimal

---

### 5. What's the highest risk task?
**Answer**: **Task 5 (CLI Integration)** 🔴

**Reasons**:
1. Depends on verifying context structure
2. Exact flag definition pattern unknown
3. Depends on other tasks (3, 4)
4. Most likely to need review/rework

**Mitigation**: Verify context structure before starting

**Second highest risk**: **Task 3 (ExecuteSQLSafe)** 🟡
- Depends on finding rowsToMaps()
- Result limit implementation needs clarity

---

## Recommendations

### Recommended Implementation Sequence

**For solo engineer**:

```
Day 1 (Blocks 1):
  ├─ Task 1: GetReadOnlyDB (45 min)
  ├─ Task 2: validateSQLQuery (30 min)
  └─ Task 4: RenderSQLResults (45 min)
    → Total: 120 minutes

Day 1 (Blocks 2):
  └─ Task 3: ExecuteSQLSafe (60 min)
    → Total: 60 minutes

Day 1 (Block 3):
  └─ Task 5: CLI Integration (30 min)
    → Total: 30 minutes

Day 2:
  └─ Task 6: Unit Tests (90 min)
    → Total: 90 minutes

Day 2+:
  ├─ Task 10: CLI Help (30 min)
  ├─ Task 12: Function Docs (45 min)
  └─ Task 11: User Guide (90 min)
```

**Total**: 465 minutes ≈ 7.75 hours (1 full day + 4 hours)
